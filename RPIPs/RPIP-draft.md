## Abstract
This informational RPIP provides information about the oDAO nodes. The two charter-required columns are "Single/Multiple Singer" (whether there is only one human that can sign, or multiple) and "Close Relationship Disclosure". The rest are all voluntarily added for transparency.

This table was updated 2024-01.
